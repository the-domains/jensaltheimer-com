Thank you [][0]for presenting Loose Ends here today.  I had very positive feedback from patrons, particularly parents who liked the fact that their kids were so engaged in something not screen based!

Thanks Jens for a great Loose Ends show this morning at Whitehorse Centre. The kids and I loved it!

Go see the show if you can. It is quirky. Funny and a lot clever.
