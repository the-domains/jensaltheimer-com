## Key Audience Segments & Possible Approaches

**School groups**

A range of workshops are available to complement the performance.

Links to the curriculum include performance, science and technology,

design and creativity, as well as moral lessons around the importance of

friendship and acceptance.

**Families**

Loose Ends is a great family show -- it's a lot of fun for kids and adults,

as there are elements to the onstage action that can be appreciated on

different levels. Loose Ends also opens up conversations around 'how

did he do that?!' and inspires follow up activities like DIY inventions

and contraptions.

If your venue has presented Jens' previous show, Squaring the Wheel,

be sure to contact those patrons and invite them to Loose Ends.

**CALD Families**

Loose Ends is presented with very reduced verbal interactions, and relies 

on its visual content to tell the story. It could thus appeal to families who

speak English as a second language. There are plenty of excellent

production photos that can be used in marketing materials to give the

flavour of the show, and its quirky creations to ensure marketing is

mostly visual rather than text heavy when targeting this segment.

**Tech Heads / Amateur Inventors**

Loose Ends is full of elaborate gadgets, inventions and contraptions. It's

a great show for people who love to know how things work. Look into

contacting junior science or design fairs, young inventor groups, or

consider a competition where kids design their own machine, and

submit a drawing and a description of what it does. The best/most

creative entry wins a double pass to the show, or a meet and greet /

backstage tour.

**Lovers of puppetry**

Loose Ends sees many everyday objects manipulated and transformed

into unexpected puppets with lifelike expressions and personality!

Offer a simple 'make your own shadow puppet' workshop in the foyer

pre-show, or use social media to share simple tutorials on transforming

everyday objects into quirky puppets.

Encourage kids to put on a puppet show with their toys for their

parents/carers before the show to get a first-hand experience of being a

puppeteer!

**Fans of Circus**

Jens is a trained circus artist, and his work is heavily influenced by circus

and physical theatre. While it is not a classic circus show, there are

elements of circus throughout Loose Ends that would appeal to circus

lovers. If your venue also hosts circus events, contact past patrons to

encourage them to book for 

this show.
