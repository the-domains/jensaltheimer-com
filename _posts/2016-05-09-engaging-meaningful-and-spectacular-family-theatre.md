**The Concept**

I believe theatre should create a space and time, where some magic happens and imagination is set free. It should switch on brains and hearts and not just confirm pre-known things and expectations.

But also a place that provides some possibility to ask questions after the show, to reflect and to try things out, in short, to engage with the seen in a more profound way.

Underlying all those elements, it should provide an intense and good time. With lots of things that make us laugh, but also make us think about the human condition and the way we walk through this life.

That talks about our power of being able to transform things, our responsibility to shape our life.

**Loose Ends**

Loose Ends is all that in a passionate way. Bringing to your venue this concept of theatre in an extravagant and lavishly equipped one man show.

Loose Ends is a quirky mix between clown powered theatre, tinker experience and a touching story.

**The How : Multi-stylistic approach**

Wacky contraptions meet headstrong puppets. Moments of circus meet shadow projections. Soulful clown meets transformed gadgets.

Expect a show that is visually bold, touching, always surprising and is pushing the theme of inventiveness.

A rollercoaster of unusual, energetic and playful scenes, where everyday objects get re-invented and start to have complete new uses and meanings.

The show uses only a few words, they are substituted by suggestive images, that challenge imagination and leave some responsibility of individual interpretation.

Storytelling from a clown's perspective: always ready to find the most unlikely solutions to get out of trouble...or deeper into it.
