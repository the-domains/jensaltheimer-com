# LOOSE ENDS: The Show

## Where Naughty Puppets meet Wacky Contraptions

MAKERS, CREATORS, STORY-LOVERS: Dive into a theatrical adventure full of action, that feels like the magic box of a bygone trickster!
Set in a wondrous tinkering heaven, the show is a celebration of the capricious. 

Familiar household items are transformed and show off with new and delightful uses, offering a humorous and human look at the world that surrounds us.
Expect clever clowning, custom- built contraptions, headstrong puppets, circus, shadow projection, music with carrots, wacky gadgets and a whole lot of fun...but don't expect that everything follows the path of your expectations! 

Loose Ends is a story about a man who thinks he can organise all his life in boxes....
well, he'll have to learn a big thing about real friendship! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a1ac7fbb-afb1-4548-a08e-8f2f1c29f835.jpg)
